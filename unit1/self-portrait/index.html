    <title>My Self Portrait</title> 
<!--
My Self-Portrait included pictures that represent me. My dad is one of the most hardworking and intelligent people I know. He works so hard for me and my brother; I am forever grateful for that. My best friend Ellen also means the work to me, and I am lucky to have my friends in my life. My dog Monkey, Sunsets, and Field hockey also bring me joy and remind me how fortunate I am. I centered all the images because these center my life and represent who I am. I sized the photos to show how often they consumed my life. Field Hockey takes up six days of my week, with four practices a week with two games. When we travel, it can take anywhere from 6 hours to a whole three days. I rarely see my dog, only when I travel back home or if my dad brings her to visit me. My dad is a lawyer and often has to come to Fredricksburg for Court, so I see him around twice a month. I see my friend Ellen a lot as she is a student here on campus. I only see the sunrise at my beach house a couple of times a year because of the 6-hour trip from my home, and I only visit 3-4 times a year.

Below to help me center my image horzontally and vertically I used W3schools. Next time I will include the link however I can not seem to find it.
