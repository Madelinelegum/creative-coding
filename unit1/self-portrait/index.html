    <title>My Self Portrait</title> 
<!--
My Self-Portrait included pictures that represent me. My dad is truly one of the most hardworking and intelligent people I know. He works so hard for me and my brother, and for that, I am forever grateful. My best friend Ellen also means the work to me, and I am lucky to have my friends in my life. My dog Monkey, Sunsets, and Field hockey also bring me joy and remind me how lucky I am. I centered all the images because these center my life and represent who I am.
